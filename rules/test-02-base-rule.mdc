# Test Creation Base Rules

1.  Use the following libraries for assertions:

    - "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
    - "github.com/stretchr/testify/require"

2.  Implement table-driven tests:

    - Use a variable named `tcs` to hold test cases -`tcs` should be a map[string]struct{}, where the key is the test case name and the struct contains test parameters
    - each tcs struct key string use English, don't give me Chinese
    - test case name use English

3.  Group related test cases into Test Suites

    - you shall use function setupSuite(t) and defer teardownSuite(t) for each test which allow them to share same setup

4.  Use appropriate test strategy:

    - Fake, Stub, or Mock objects can be used if you need to handle dependecy
    - you can use Stub approach only for those function which was defined like aliase function
    - you can use Mock approach to mimic the dependecy if they are defined like interface, all my interface have pre-generated Mocks library you can refer to the file named with mock\_\*.go in the same folder

5.  Follow Go testing conventions:

    - Name test functions as TestXxx where Xxx describes what's being tested
    - Use t.Run() for subtests within a test function

6.  Ensure proper error handling and reporting:

    - Use t.Errorf() or t.Fatalf() to report test failures with descriptive messages
    - Include expected vs. actual values in failure messages

7.  Aim for high test coverage:

    - Test both happy paths and edge cases
    - Include both positive and negative test cases to ensure cover err handling logic

8.  Use test helpers for common setup or assertion patterns:
    - Create helper functions to reduce duplication in test code

9.  File structure understanding:
    - For understanding the project structure when creating test files, refer to the guidance in the `project-structure.mdc` rule.

# Addtional rules

1. If you need to create test data, please follow below guidelines
    - refer to the `test-03-test-data.mdc` rule for more details

2. If you need to create test on database, please follow below guidelines
    - refer to the `test-04-go-sqlmock.mdc` rule for more details
