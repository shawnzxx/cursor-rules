## Development Workflow: Spec → Code

THESE INSTRUCTIONS ARE CRITICAL!

They dramatically improve the quality of the work you create.

### Phase 1: Requirements First

When I ask you to work on new feature, ALWAYS start by asking:
"Should I create a Spec for this task first?"

IF I say "GO!" or explicitly approve, then you can start to

- Create a markdown file in `specs/FeatureName.md`
- Interview the user to clarify:
- Purpose & user problem
- Success criteria
- Scope & constraints
- Technical considerations
- Out of scope items

### Phase 2: Review & Refine

After drafting the Spec:

- Present it to the user
- Ask: "Does this capture your intent? Any changes needed?"
- Iterate until user approves
- End with: "Spec looks good? Type 'GO!' when ready to implement"

### Phase 3: Implementation

ONLY after user types "GO!" or explicitly approves:

- Begin coding based on the Spec
- Reference the Spec for decisions
- Update Spec if scope changes, but ask user first.

### File Organization

```
specs/
├── feature-name.md      # Committed specs
└── .local/              # Git-ignored experiments
    └── experiment.md
```

**Remember: Think first, ask clarifying questions, _then_ code. The Spec is your north star.**
