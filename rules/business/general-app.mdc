# App Layer (Use Cases) Guidelines

This rule applies to files within the App Layer (`[api/internal/app/](mdc:api/internal/app)`), which corresponds to **Use Cases** in Clean Architecture.

## Core Principles

- **Orchestration**: The App Layer orchestrates the flow of data between the API/Controllers and the Business/Entities layers.
- **Application-Specific Logic**: Contains application-specific business rules and logic that are not part of the core domain (Business Layer).
- **Use Case Driven**: Organizes logic around specific application use cases or features.

## File Placement

- **Domain-Specific Use Cases**: Place orchestration logic and use case implementations within specific subdirectories under:
  `[api/internal/app/domain/](mdc:api/internal/app/domain)`
- **Application Errors**: Define custom error types specific to the App Layer in:
  `[api/internal/app/errs/](mdc:api/internal/app/errs)`
- **Shared SDKs**: If there are reusable components _within_ the App Layer across different use cases, place them in:
  `[api/internal/app/sdk/](mdc:api/internal/app/sdk)`

Remember that the App Layer depends on the Business Layer but should not be depended upon by it.
