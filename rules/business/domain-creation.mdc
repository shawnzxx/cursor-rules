# Domain Creation Guidelines

## Implementation Steps

### File naming convition
- Use clear, descriptive names that reflect the domain's purpose
- Avoid generic names like "utils" or "common" for domains
- Use lowercase names with underscores for multi-word domains (e.g., `user_management`)

### File organization
Create the domain structure in each layer:
   - REST handlers should go in `api/internal/api/domain/[your_domain]/rest/`
   - Kafka handlers should go in `api/internal/api/domain/[your_domain]/kafka/`
   - app domain business logic goes into `api/internal/app/domain/[your_domain]/*.go`
   - domain logics goes into `api/internal/business/domain/[your_domain]/*.go`
   - if require new constant value goes into `api/internal/constant/[related_constants]/*.go`
   - orm logic goes into `api/internal/repository/orm/*.go`

### App folder logic
- Implement use cases in `api/internal/app/domain/[your_domain]/*.go`
- Service interfaces should be defined here
- Orchestration logic between different domains should be implemented here

### Business folder logic
- Domain entities should be defined in `api/internal/business/domain/[your_domain]/*.go`
- Core business rules and validations should be implemented here
- Define appropriate repository interfaces inside the file

### Storer layer
- this package mainly to implement the business folder interface which can be found in folder `api/internal/business/domain/[your_domain]/*.go`
- package name follow `[your_domain]db`
- file name follow `[your_domain]db.go`
