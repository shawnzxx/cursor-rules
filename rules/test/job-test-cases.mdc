# Job Test Case Guidelines

This rule applies when working with test files (`*_test.go`) specifically for batch jobs.

## Test Case Location

-   Test cases for specific batch jobs should be located within the `testcase` directory corresponding to the job name.
-   The structure is:
    `[api/cmd/job/testcase/{job_name}/](mdc:api/cmd/job/testcase)`

Replace `{job_name}` with the actual name of the job being tested.

Example: Tests for a job named `user_migration` would go into `[api/cmd/job/testcase/user_migration/](mdc:api/cmd/job/testcase/user_migration)`.
